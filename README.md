# CS3330: Object Oriented Programming

This course focuses on teaching the student to master the necessary object-oriented programming concepts: abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, 
inheritance, and interfaces. Additional extensive modeling will be used with UML diagramming techniques. The Java language is used to illustrate the 
fundamental principles of object-oriented software design and implementation. Modern programming topics, including Graphical User Interface and event-driven 
programming, are also tackled.

In this course we primarily code in Java.

This course was taken during the Spring semester 2023 at the University of Missouri - Columbia.
